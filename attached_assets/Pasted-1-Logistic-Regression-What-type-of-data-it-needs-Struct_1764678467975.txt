1. Logistic Regression
✔️ What type of data it needs:
Structured, tabular, numeric or categorical health data.
Examples:
Age, sex, BMI
Blood pressure, cholesterol
Lab results (A1C, WBC, creatinine, etc.)
Comorbidities (diabetes, COPD, CHF)
Symptoms (coded yes/no)
Social factors (smoking, alcohol)
Used for:
Disease risk prediction (e.g., stroke, sepsis, diabetes)
Binary classification (stable / unstable, triage yes/no)
✅ 2. Random Forest
✔️ Data required:
Structured clinical data with mixed types — numeric + categorical + binary.
Examples:
EHR fields
Vitals trend snapshots
Lab results
Claims/insurance features
Visit counts, hospitalization history
Used for:
Sepsis prediction
Readmission risk
Clinical deterioration detection
✅ 3. XGBoost / LightGBM
✔️ Data required:
Same as Random Forest — high-dimensional structured data.
XGBoost is very good with:
Sparse hospital data
Missing values
High-cardinality features (e.g., ICD codes)
Common data points:
Demographics
Labs & vitals
Diagnoses & procedures (ICD-10, CPT)
Medication lists
Prior admissions
Clinical scoring systems
Used for:
Early warning scores
Risk stratification
Claims fraud detection
Population health models
✅ 4. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
✔️ Data required:
Medium-sized numerical datasets (small to mid-sized cohorts).
Examples:
Pathology measurements
Genomic/molecular features
Lab-derived numeric vectors
Clinical feature sets (10–200 variables)
Used for:
Cancer prediction on small datasets
Binary classification with few samples
Biomarker-based risk models
SVM is good when data is small but features are informative.
✅ 5. LSTM / RNN (Time-series models)
✔️ Needs sequence data — anything that changes over time.
Examples:
Vitals time series (HR, BP, RR, SpO₂)
ICU monitor data (minute-level trends)
ECG waveforms
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
Wearable sensor streams (motion, HRV, sleep stages)
Medication timing logs
Respiratory waveforms
Used for:
ICU deterioration prediction
Arrhythmia detection (ECG)
Time-series forecasting of patient condition
✅ 6. K-Means / Clustering
✔️ Needs unlabeled structured data to find patterns.
Examples:
EHR data for patient phenotypes
Behavioral data (app engagement, symptoms over time)
Lab profiles
Chronic disease trajectories
Wearable-use profiles
Used for:
Patient segmentation
Phenotyping (e.g., diabetes subtypes)
Outlier detection (anomalies)
K-means requires:
Numeric features (categorical need to be encoded)
Preprocessing (scaling/normalization)
