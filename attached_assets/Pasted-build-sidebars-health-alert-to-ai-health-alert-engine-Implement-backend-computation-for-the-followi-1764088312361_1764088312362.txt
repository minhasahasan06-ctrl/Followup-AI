build sidebars health alert to ai health alert engine-
Implement backend computation for the following trend features:
1. Z-score deviation for each metric
Compare today’s value vs user’s 14-day baseline
Formula:z = (current - mean_14d) / std_14d
2. Rolling slopes
For every tracked metric compute:
3-day slope
7-day slope
14-day slope
Use simple linear regression on rolling windows.
3. Volatility Index
volatility = std(14-day values)
 4. Composite Trend Risk Index
Weighted sum of:
* z-score magnitude
* volatility
* slope
* engagement score drop
Scale output 0–100.
5. Organ-System Behavior Scores
(Behavioral clusters, NOT medical)
* “Respiratory-like pattern” (based on activity, rate-of-breath audio pattern if available, pacing)
* “Fluid-like pattern” (weight trend + activity trend)
* “Mood/Neuro pattern” (mood + consistency + stability)
* “Behavioral stability pattern” (consistency + interactions + check-ins)
These are statistical pattern groups only.
6. Daily Stability Score
Single front-facing score for patient:

stability = 100 - composite_volatility - negative_slopes - missed_checkins * penalty
7. Escalation Probability (ML ranking only)
XGBoost model that outputs a priority score (0–1) for how unusual the combined metrics are.
NOT a diagnosis — ONLY alert sorting.

B. ENGAGEMENT & WORKFLOW METRICS (Part 11)
8. Adherence Score

adherence = (completed_actions / expected_actions) * 100
Actions = check-ins, captures, surveys.
9. Time-to-Alert
Time from anomaly → alert creation. Log automatically.
10. Alert Frequency
Track number of alerts generated per user per week.
11. False-positive proxy measurement
If clinician dismisses alert → mark as “low relevance".
12. Care-Team Workload Score
Simple computation:

workload_reduction = (manual_checks_avoided / baseline_manual_checks)

C. QUALITY OF LIFE METRICS (Part 12)
13. Daily Wellness Index
Combine:
* mood
* energy
* mobility trend
* adherence Output scaled 0–100.
14. Functional Status Proxy

functional_status = weighted(activity_level, gait_speed, engagement)
15. Self-care Consistency
Medication + hydration intake logs + check-in streaks.

2️⃣ ALERT TYPES TO BUILD
A. TREND ALERTS
Triggered when ANY of these happen:
1. z-score >= 2.5
2. 7-day slope strongly negative
3. volatility index > system threshold (configurable)
4. composite trend score crosses user baseline by >20%
B. ENGAGEMENT ALERTS
1. missed 3 check-ins in 48 hours
2. adherence < 60%
3. engagement drop > 30% vs 14-day baseline
C. QUALITY-OF-LIFE ALERTS
1. wellness index drops by >20 points
2. functional status drops >30% in 3 days
3. self-care consistency drops below threshold
All alerts must be:
“Observational behavioral alert — requires human review. NOT a medical diagnosis.”

3️⃣ DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
Create tables:
trend_metrics
* id
* patient_id
* metric_name
* raw_value
* z_score
* slope_3d
* slope_7d
* slope_14d
* volatility
* timestamp
engagement_metrics
* patient_id
* adherence
* checkins_completed
* checkins_expected
* engagement_score
* timestamp
qol_metrics
* patient_id
* wellness_index
* functional_status
* selfcare_score
* timestamp
alerts
* alert_id
* patient_id
* type
* severity
* contributing_metrics (json)
* created_at
* status (new, acknowledged, dismissed)
* clinician_id

4️⃣ WORKER LOGIC (IMPORTANT)
Create a background worker that:
1. Pulls new metric entries
2. Computes all Part 10–12 metrics
3. Calculates trend + engagement + QOL scores
4. Runs alert rules
5. Writes alerts to DB
6. Sends notifications to clinician dashboard

5️⃣ CLINICIAN DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS
Build dashboard with:
* Active alerts list
* Trend timeline graphs (z-scores, slopes)
* Engagement history
* Wellness history
* “Acknowledge / Dismiss” workflow
* Full audit trail

6️⃣ NOTIFICATION RULES
Send notifications ONLY for:
* high-severity trend anomalies
* engagement failure
* QOL deterioration
No medical language. No clinical claims. Observational only.

7️⃣ COMPLIANCE GUARDRAILS
The system must automatically add this text to all alerts:
“This is an observational pattern alert. Not a diagnosis or medical opinion.”
No decision support. No prediction of disease. No “diagnosis words.” No symptom labeling.
