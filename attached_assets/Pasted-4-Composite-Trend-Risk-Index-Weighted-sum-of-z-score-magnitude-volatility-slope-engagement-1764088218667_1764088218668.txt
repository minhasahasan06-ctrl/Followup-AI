4. Composite Trend Risk Index
Weighted sum of:


z-score magnitude


volatility


slope


engagement score drop


Scale output 0–100.
5. Organ-System Behavior Scores
(Behavioral clusters, NOT medical)


“Respiratory-like pattern” (based on activity, rate-of-breath audio pattern if available, pacing)


“Fluid-like pattern” (weight trend + activity trend)


“Mood/Neuro pattern” (mood + consistency + stability)


“Behavioral stability pattern” (consistency + interactions + check-ins)


These are statistical pattern groups only.
6. Daily Stability Score
Single front-facing score for patient:
stability = 100 - composite_volatility - negative_slopes - missed_checkins * penalty

7. Escalation Probability (ML ranking only)
XGBoost model that outputs a priority score (0–1) for how unusual the combined metrics are.
NOT a diagnosis — ONLY alert sorting.

B. ENGAGEMENT & WORKFLOW METRICS (Part 11)
8. Adherence Score
adherence = (completed_actions / expected_actions) * 100

Actions = check-ins, captures, surveys.
9. Time-to-Alert
Time from anomaly → alert creation. Log automatically.
10. Alert Frequency
Track number of alerts generated per user per week.
11. False-positive proxy measurement
If clinician dismisses alert → mark as “low relevance".
12. Care-Team Workload Score
Simple computation:
workload_reduction = (manual_checks_avoided / baseline_manual_checks)


C. QUALITY OF LIFE METRICS (Part 12)
13. Daily Wellness Index
Combine:


mood


energy


mobility trend


adherence
Output scaled 0–100.


14. Functional Status Proxy
functional_status = weighted(activity_level, gait_speed, engagement)

15. Self-care Consistency
Medication + hydration intake logs + check-in streaks.

2️⃣ ALERT TYPES TO BUILD
A. TREND ALERTS
Triggered when ANY of these happen:


z-score >= 2.5


7-day slope strongly negative


volatility index > system threshold (configurable)


composite trend score crosses user baseline by >20%


B. ENGAGEMENT ALERTS


missed 3 check-ins in 48 hours


adherence < 60%


engagement drop > 30% vs 14-day baseline


C. QUALITY-OF-LIFE ALERTS


wellness index drops by >20 points


functional status drops >30% in 3 days


self-care consistency drops below threshold


All alerts must be:

“Observational behavioral alert — requires human review. NOT a medical diagnosis.”


3️⃣ DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
Create tables:
trend_metrics


id


patient_id


metric_name


raw_value


z_score


slope_3d


slope_7d


slope_14d


volatility


timestamp


engagement_metrics


patient_id


adherence


checkins_completed


checkins_expected


engagement_score


timestamp


qol_metrics


patient_id


wellness_index


functional_status


selfcare_score


timestamp


alerts


alert_id


patient_id


type


severity


contributing_metrics (json)


created_at


status (new, acknowledged, dismissed)


clinician_id



4️⃣ WORKER LOGIC (IMPORTANT)
Create a background worker that:


Pulls new metric entries


Computes all Part 10–12 metrics


Calculates trend + engagement + QOL scores


Runs alert rules


Writes alerts to DB


Sends notifications to clinician dashboard



5️⃣ CLINICIAN DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS
Build React dashboard with:


Active alerts list


Trend timeline graphs (z-scores, slopes)


Engagement history


Wellness history


“Acknowledge / Dismiss” workflow


Full audit trail



6️⃣ NOTIFICATION RULES
Send notifications ONLY for:


high-severity trend anomalies


engagement failure


QOL deterioration


No medical language.
No clinical claims.
Observational only.

7️⃣ COMPLIANCE GUARDRAILS
The system must automatically add this text to all alerts:

“This is an observational pattern alert. Not a diagnosis or medical opinion.”

No decision support.
No prediction of disease.
No “diagnosis words.”
No symptom labeling.

8️⃣ DEPLOYMENT TARGETS
Replit dev → AWS ECS/EKS for production.

END OF SPEC FOR REPLIT

If you want, I can now also generate:
✅ the full DB schema (DDL)
✅ the FastAPI backend skeleton
✅ the worker code that computes z-scores, slopes, and alert rules
Just say: “Generate DDL + backend skeleton” and I’ll produce it.
